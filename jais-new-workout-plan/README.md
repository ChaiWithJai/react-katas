# Kata 3

Great job you completed your first 2 katas! Wahoo!

In the last kata, you wrote a little JSX! Read more in the (docs)[https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html].

Now in this kata let's get **even more** comfortable with writing JSX by learning how we display data with JSX.

To start, navigate to the quote component `/src` directory.

If you feel stuck, please follow the (docs)[https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx] about embedding expressions in JSX.
