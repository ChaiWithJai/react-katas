# Kata 5

Last kata for this exercise here!

So far you've learned:

- How to write a component
- How to next a component
- Writing dynamic content using JSX to display data
- Conditionally rendering information

Now, its time to learn about events.

As we remember, mouse clicks and keyboard taps aren't part of our application. We don't need to worry about writing the logic to handle these things. Thankfully, the browser handles it for us. The browser tracks all of these events, and if we want to hook into a particular event if we want to add a behavior on click, when a user is typing or if a user changes their volume level we must use attach an event listener to a DOM element and pass it a callback function that will be invoked when the event occurs as detected by the browser.

Last time around, we needed to write a bit of code to do this.

In this example, its gonna be super easy. Be sure to read the (docs)[https://beta.reactjs.org/learn#responding-to-events].
